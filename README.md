# How to setup a Windows Active Directory (within Virtual Box) to create a corporate network.
### Learning Objectves:
1. We will learn how to provision multiple virutal machines.
2. Configure a basic Windows networking environment with Active Directory.
3. Execute PowerShell script to further our Active Directory environment. 


### Technologies and Protocols:
* Oracle Virutal Box
* Window's Active Directory
* Window's networking: Domain controler, DHCP and NAT
* Powershell 


### Overview:
![](images/WindowsADdrawIO.png)
Pictured above is a high-level overview of our corporate network. First, we are going to download Virtual Box, Windows 10 and Windows server 2019 ISO files (**see below**). Then, we are going to create our first virtual machine with Windows server 2019 installed. This will act as our doamin controller (DC) and where we will house Active Directory (AD). We are going to give our DC two network interface cards (NICs): one will connect to the external ![#f03c15](https://via.placeholder.com/15/f03c15/f03c15.png) `internet` the other will be for the ![#1589F0](https://via.placeholder.com/15/1589F0/1589F0.png) `internal` network so that the Windows 10 clients can connect through and reach the internet.

We will assign IP addressing for the internal network, while the external network automatically gets IP addressing from your home network. After assinging IPs we will create our domain thorugh Active Directory, configure network address translation (NAT) and setup Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol (DHCP) for internet connectivity.

Finally, we will download and run a PowerShell script that will automatically create +1k users in Active Directory to simumlate our enterprise users. 

After completing our DC virtual machine, we will create another virtual machine that will be our Windows 10 client. This client machine will connect to our ![#1589F0](https://via.placeholder.com/15/1589F0/1589F0.png) `internal` network through our DC's domain name (eventually reaching the ![#f03c15](https://via.placeholder.com/15/f03c15/f03c15.png) `internet`). 



## Step 1: [Download: Virtual Box](https://www.virtualbox.org/wiki/Downloads "Virtual Box"), [Windows '19 server ISO](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/evalcenter/download-windows-server-2019 "Windows '19 server ISO") and [Windows 10 ISO](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/evalcenter/download-windows-server-2019 "Windows 10 ISO").
- Virtual box (download ‘VM Virtual Box Extension Pack’ found on the same page as Virtual Box for your host machine download )
- ISO: Windows Server and Windows 10
    - Set RAM (2048 MB is fine enough) and memory (30 GB is fine) to your needs.
- Create a virtual hard disk now
- VDI
- Dynamically allocate
    - Under settings > general > advance set ‘shared clipboard’ and ‘drag’n’drop’ to bidirectional (drag files + copy/paste from host machine)
    
![](images/Home%20Lab%20-DC/DomainController/DC1.png) 

## Step 2: Our goal is to have two NICs (network interface cards); one for the intranet and one for the internet.
- Under settings > network > Adapter 2 tab: select Internal Network. This will connect our machine to the intranet (internal network).
- The Adapter 1 tab is set to NAT network by default (our connection to the internet).

## Step 4 Configure your new Windows server machine (selecting standard desktop experience).
- This may take a while

![](images/Home%20Lab%20-DC/DomainController/DC4.png)

> Windows DC
> 
> **Username: Administrator**
>
> **Password: Password1**
> 
> If asked to Press Ctrl+Alt+Delete to Unlock the home page click Input from the top of the page > keyboard > Insert Ctrl+Alt+Delete (these instructions are for a Mac host machine, but similar instructions for a Windows Host).

## Step 5: Install windows guest additions 64
- First, click Devices (found on top of the screen, on Mac) > insert guest additions CD image
- Click file explorer > this pc and double click CD Drive (D:) Virtual Box Guest Additions
- Double click and install BoxWindowsAdditions-amd64

![](images/Home%20Lab%20-DC/DomainController/DC5.png)

## Step 6: Set up NIC - internal connection 
- Click the little computer symbol found in the bottom right of the screen
- Choose ‘undefined network’ > change adapter options
- We should see two networks on this machine. Re-name the left most inter-net and the second one intra-net.
- *Inter-net is our NIC to the internet and intra-net is our NIC to our internal network.*

![](images/Home%20Lab%20-DC/DomainController/DC6.png)

## Step 7: After re-naming, we need to assign an IP to intra-net (DHCP automatically gives inter-net an IP).
- Right-click intra-net > properties  > double click internet protocol version (TCP/IPv4)
- Assign IPs as seen in screenshot below:

![](images/Home%20Lab%20-DC/DomainController/DC7.png)

## Step 8: Re-name this PC
- Right-click the start window found at the bottom left > system > rename this pc

- Now to enable the execution of scripts in PowerShell: on the command line write Set-Execution Policy Unrestricted and click Yes to All when prompted 

![](images/Home%20Lab%20-DC/DomainController/DC17b.png)

> Some explanation to Create Users script: the script creates users (New-Aduser) and gives them the user name found in names.txt file
> ($USER_FIRST_LAST_LIST = Get-content .\names.txt); additionally their passwords are set to Password1 ($PASSWORD_FOR_USERS = Password1)

## Step 17C: Let’s execute our script 
- On the command line, let’s change our directory to execute our code: cd C:\users\your-username\desktop\AD_PS-master
- Your-username should begin with “a-“. TIP: use the TAB to auto-complete.
- From the top, hit the green play button icon to run the script. Click Run once when prompted
- Viola! The user accounts should be created in real-time.
- Go back to Server Manager > Dashboard and click tools > Active Directory Users and Computers. Right-click mydomain.com and click refresh. Under the _USERS folder within mydomain.com, we can confirm our newly created users.
- If you right-click the _USERS folder > find… we can search for specific users and edit their settings. Try searching for yourself and play around!

# Time to create our **Windows 10 Client** in Virtual Box.

### Step 1: Head back into virtual box and click > new; name it CLIENT1 with a version of Windows 10 (64-bit). Click Continue. 
- 2048 MB of RAM is fine.
- Create a virtual hard disk now
- VDI
- Dynamically allocated
- Under settings > advance set Shared Clipboard and Drag’n’Drop to Bidirectional 
- Under system > Network select Internal Network (instead of using our home network with NAT, we are going to use our internal ’corporate’ network)
- Double-click CLIENT1 to start up and click the folder icon with the green arrow
- Click add disk image and find your Windows 10 ISO file to upload

![](images/Home%20Lab%20-DC/Client/C1.png)

## Step 2: Install and set up CLIENT1
- Custom install 
- I don’t have a product key
- (If prompted select Windows 10 Pro)
- (If prompted select join Domain)
- Name: user, on password click next
- Turn off all services and Cortona

## Step 3: Let’s test connectivity (remember, we are using the DC as our default gateway to connect us to the internet)
- Search and open the command prompt
- On the command line: ping www.google.com
- If zero packets are lost this means a couple of things; (1) our DNS resolved and our DNS server is up and running, and (2) our connectivity to the internet is up!
- The DC forwards are ping requests and sends them right back to us successfully.

![](images/Home%20Lab%20-DC/Client/C3.png)

## Step 4: Join this client to our domain controller (and rename)
- Right-click start button > system
- Scroll to the bottom and click Rename this PC (advance)
- Click Change… and rename it to CLIENT1
- Select Domain under Member of and type mydomain.com. Click ok
- When prompted sign in with your domain login: a-your_name AND password (Password1).
- Restart your computer 

![](images/Home%20Lab%20-DC/Client/C4.png)

## Step 5: Check Address Lease on DC
- Back on DC, go to your Server Manager Dashboard > Tools > DHCP
- Under dc.mydomain.com > IPv4 > Scope > Address lease we can see the IP our CLIENT1 is assigned to (in an enterprise environment this space would be filled with our CLIENT IPs).

![](images/Home%20Lab%20-DC/Client/C5.png)

## Step 6: Find CLIENT1 on DC
- On DC, click start > Windows Administrator Tools > Active Directory Users and Computers
- Under the Computers container/folder we see our CLIENT1 computer

![](images/Home%20Lab%20-DC/Client/C6.png)

## Step 7: Use generated user to log into CLIENT1
- Back on CLIENT1 sign out and sign back in by selecting Other User from the bottom
- Choose a name from the names.txt file (from our PowerShell script) and login **Password1**

![](images/Home%20Lab%20-DC/Client/C7.png)

 And we’re in! (Use the `whoami` command to confirm).
